# Public Health Case Surveillance Dashboard

## Overview

This project features a comprehensive **Public Health Case Surveillance Dashboard** developed in Microsoft Excel. It is designed to monitor, track, and analyze fatality cases over time to support data-driven decision-making by epidemiologists, public health officials, and policymakers.

The dashboard provides critical insights into mortality trends, geographic disease distribution, and at-risk populations by visualizing key epidemiological data. It aims to facilitate timely interventions and improve public health outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Public health surveillance in Nigeria continues to face significant challenges, hindering timely detection, reporting, and response to disease outbreaks and fatalities. Despite the presence of various health institutions and data collection efforts, gaps in surveillance systems contribute to delayed intervention, misallocation of resources, and ultimately, increased fatality rates. The goal of this analysis is to leverage tools like interactive dashboards, epidemiological metrics, and demographic breakdowns, to gain deeper insights into health trends, monitor fatality rates effectively, and implement timely responses to reduce preventable deaths across Nigeria

### Data Analysis

---

### üìä General Statistics
 - Total Cases Reported: 10,000 cases
 - Case Fatality Rate: 49.75% ‚Äî nearly 1 in 2 reported cases result in death, which is alarmingly high.
 - Confirmed Cases: 50.33%, indicating only half of reported cases are officially confirmed.
 - Average Reporting Delay: 5.03 days, which could significantly hinder timely outbreak response.

### üìà Monthly Trends
 Peak fatalities were recorded in July (443 deaths) followed by August (433) while April (373) had the lowest number of reported deaths. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend shows sustained high mortality through mid-year.

### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Demographics
 Middle-aged individuals (3,348 cases) report slightly more cases than the young (3,422) and old (3,230), indicating a fairly even spread.However, young individuals have the highest number of deaths (1,709), making them the most vulnerable group.

### üß¨ Gender-Based Analysis
 Reports are nearly evenly split with Male (5,020) vs. Female (4,980) and Fatality rates are almost identical with Male: 50.41% and Female: 49.59%. Gender does not appear to be a major factor in mortality.

### ü¶† Disease-Specific Trends
The top 3 diseases by total deaths are Malaria (1,031), Rubella (1,026) and Ebola (1,015) with Lassa Fever having the shortest average delay (4.84 days), while Rubella has the longest (5.11 days). Most diseases show similar reporting delays (~5 days), suggesting a system-wide lag in case reporting.

### Location
The highest count of cases was recorded in Oyo state (1042 cases) with Borno state having the longest report day of 5.14days. 512 deaths in Rivers, indicating either a severe outbreat or late reporting and 531 confirmed cases in Kano, showing strong detection but possibly still high transmission!
